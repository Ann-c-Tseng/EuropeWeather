# Europe Weather Lookup Application

### Project Summary:
This is a weather app that displays the weather &amp; temperature of a selected European city for the current week.
The weather image icons and city_coordinates.csv were provided by Coursera's project prompt: https://www.coursera.org/learn/showcase-build-a-website-api-html-javascript-json/home/week/1

### Project Process + Solution:
I started by first data-organizing the csv's city, country, and respective longitude and latitude information within the application using JS, before establishing how to use that data to be displayed in the user's selection drop-down. After I was able to get the longitude, latitude, city, and country selection to be implemented, I then linked the user selected data to the API to access the corresponding weather forcast for the given week. Using the 7time API, I gathered all the information I wanted to present for the weekly weather, such as the week date, corresponding weather image based on weather condition, the weather condition description, and the lowest/highest temperature of that day. Once the API was able to provide me the data and I displayed it all simply on the application, I then transitioned my attention onto styling the information to make the product aesthetically presentable.

### Tools Used:
JavaScript, Jquery, HTML, CSS, CSV of various European cities and their longitude/latitude locations, and 7timer API for weather forcast
